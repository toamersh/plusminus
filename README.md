# plusminus
Simple Flask-based Python web server for testing different hosting options ...

plusminus.py imports both the pprint and flask modules and creates a Flask instance (i.e. a web server) named app.  In the last lines of the script, app is configured to run on the host machineâ€™s internal IP address using TCP port 1234 when the script is executed.  app accepts input as either parameters embedded in the URL of a HTTP GET or JSON included in a HTTP POST.  The method handling the GET adds and subtracts 3 to the base number passed in the URL and returns both numbers.  The method handling the POST adds and subtracts a number received as a parameter in the POST and performs the same addition and subtraction of that number to the base number also passed in the same JSON payload - and returns the results in JSON format.

plusminusClienty.py is a simple client to pass parameters as JSON in a HTTP POST to the server.
